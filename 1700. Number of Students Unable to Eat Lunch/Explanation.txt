We start by counting the number of students who want circle sandwiches and the number who want square sandwiches and store them in their own variables.
We then go through the sandwiches and every time we see a circle sandwich we decrease the number of circle students and do the same for square sandwiches and square students.
this works because we have a circular queue, a student of the right type will eventually make it to the start of the queue.
If at any time we have a sandwich and we don't have a student that wants to eat that type of sandwich we return the number of students of the other type.
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we move through the sandwich and student arrays once.
The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because no matter the size of the input array we only ever create 2 constantly sized variables.
